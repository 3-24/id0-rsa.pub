## [Rail Fence Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher)
Just follow above wikipedia link for explanation on this classical cipher.

## Brute Force on Key

Since the ciphertext is not long, it is good a approach to try brute forcing on key. Then this is just a PS problem. Rearrange the ciphertext programmaticaly. I recommand to not see my [solution.py](https://github.com/3-24/id0-rsa.pub/blob/master/34_Rail_Fence/solution.py) 'cause it sucks.
